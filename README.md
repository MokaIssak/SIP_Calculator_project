## How to Use (Step-by-Step)

Follow these simple steps to use the SIP Calculator:

### Step 1: Open the Calculator

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `sip_calculator` folder.
3. Open the `sip.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Step 2: Set Your Investment Parameters

1. **Monthly Investment**: Use the slider to set how much you want to invest each month. The default is ₹5,000. You can adjust it from ₹1,000 to ₹100,000. The current value is displayed next to the slider.
2. **Expected Return Rate**: Adjust the slider for the annual return rate you expect (e.g., 12%). It ranges from 1% to 20%. The percentage is shown in real-time.
3. **Time Period**: Select how many years you plan to invest (e.g., 10 years). The slider goes from 1 to 40 years, and the value updates live.

### Step 3: Calculate Your Results

1. Once you've set your inputs, click the green **"INVEST NOW"** button.
2. The calculator will instantly compute and display:
   - **Invested Amount**: The total amount you've put in over the years.
   - **Estimated Returns**: The profit or growth from your investment.
   - **Total Value**: The sum of invested amount plus returns (your future wealth).

### Step 4: Experiment and Plan

- Try different combinations of monthly investment, return rates, and time periods to see how they affect your results.
- Use this tool to plan your financial goals, such as saving for retirement or a child's education.

## Example Calculation

Suppose you invest ₹5,000 monthly at a 12% annual return for 10 years:

- **Invested Amount**: ₹6,00,000
- **Estimated Returns**: ₹4,92,000 (approximately)
- **Total Value**: ₹10,92,000

_Note: This is an estimate based on compound interest. Actual returns may vary due to market conditions._
